# Assignment 1

## 1. What is `NPM`?

```
NPM is a package manager for the JavaScript programming language maintained by NPM, Inc. NPM is the default package manager for the JavaScript runtime environment Node.js and is included as a recommended feature in the Node.js installer.

It consists of a command line client, also called npm, and an online database of public and paid-for private packages, called the npm registry. The registry is accessed via the client, and the available packages can be browsed and searched via the npm website. The package manager and the registry are managed by npm, Inc.

```

## 2. What is `Parcel/Webpack`? Why do we need it?

```
Parcel and webpack are the bundlers used mostly for JavaScript or Typescript code that helps you to minify, clean, and make your code compact so that it becomes easier to send a request or receive the response from the server when it usually takes you to transfer multiple files without using any bundler for loading the page of your application. Both of these bundlers substantially reduce the time it takes for the transfer of data and files to the server from the application. Along with that both bundlers parcel and webpack remove the unnecessary comments, new lines, any kind of block delimiters, and white spaces while the functionality of the code remains unchanged.

```

## 3. What is `.parcel-cache`?

```
The .parcel-cache stores information about your project when parcel builds it, so that when it rebuilds, it doesn't have to re-parse and re-analyze everything from scratch. It's a key reason why parcel can be so fast in development mode.

```

## 4. What is `npx` ?

```
NPX stands for Node Package eXecute. It is simply an NPM package runner. It allows developers to execute any Javascript Package available on the NPM registry without even installing it. NPX is installed automatically with NPM version 5.2.0 and above.

```

## 5. What is difference between `dependencies` vs `devDependencies`?

```
In package.json file, there is an object called 'dependencies' and it consists of all the packages that are used in the project with its version number. So, whenever you install any library that is required in your project as a global dependency that library you can find it in the 'dependencies' object.

In package.json file, there is an object called as 'devDependencies' and it consists of all the packages that are used in the project in its development phase and not in the production or testing environment with its version number. So, whenever you want to install any library that is required only in your development phase then you can find it in the 'devDependencies' object.

```

## 6. What is Tree Shaking?

```
Tree shaking is a term commonly used within a JavaScript context to describe the removal of dead code.
It relies on the import and export statements to detect if code modules are exported and imported for use between JavaScript files.
In modern JavaScript applications, we use module bundlers (e.g., webpack or Parcel etc) to automatically remove dead code when bundling multiple JavaScript files into single files. This is important for preparing code that is production ready, for example with clean structures and minimal file size.

```

## 7. What is Hot Module Replacement?

```
Hot Module Replacement (HMR) exchanges, adds, or removes modules while an application is running, without a full reload. This can significantly speed up development in a few ways:

1. Retain application state which is lost during a full reload.
2. Save valuable development time by only updating what's changed.
3. Instantly update the browser when modifications are made to CSS/JS in the source code, which is almost comparable to changing styles directly in the browser's dev tools.

Refer: https://webpack.js.org/concepts/hot-module-replacement/

```

```
 1.Creation of Live Server

 6. Code cleanup
 7. Local and Production build
 8. Super Fast Build algorithm
 9. Image Optimization
 10. Caching while development
 11. Code Compression
 12. Compatibility with old version of browsers
 13. HTTPS on Dev
 14. Port creation
 15. Consistent Hashing Algorithm
 16. Zero Configuration
 17. Transitive Dependency resolutions

```

## 9. What is `.gitignore`? What should we add and not add into it?

```

.gitignore file is a text file that tells Git which files or folders to ignore in a project. Generally we add those files and folders in .gitignore file which can be generated during the build process in server.

```

## 10. What is the difference between `package.json` and `package-lock.json`?

```
In Node.js, 'package.json' is a versioning file used to install multiple packages in your project. As you initialize your node application, you will see three files installed in your app that is 'node_modules', 'package.json', and 'package.lock.json'.

'package.lock.json' is created for locking the dependency with the installed version. It will install the exact latest version of that package in your application and save it in 'package.json'. Let’s say if the current version of the package is 1.3.2 then it will save the version with (^) sign. Here carot(^) means, it will support any higher version with major version 1 for eg. 1.2.2.

Without package.lock.json, there might be some differences in installed versions in different environments. To overcome this problem, package.lock.json is created to have the same results in every environment. It should be in source control with the package.json file because if any other user will clone the project and install dependencies then it will install the exact same dependencies as in package.lock.json to avoid differences.

```

## 11. Why should I not modify `package-lock.json`?

```
If I modify 'package-lock.json' file then it will download different versions of dependencies for the same project in multiple environments which may cause unstable workflow on the application.

```

## 12. What is `node_modules` ? Is it a good idea to push that on git?

```

node_modules is the placeholder where all the library files get download whenever we run 'npm install'. The command run, goes through the package-lock.json and downloads the dependencies on the server. So package-lock.json and package.json are enough to re-create the bulky node_modules so that it is not at all a good idea to push it on git.

```

## 13. What is the `dist` folder?

```

This is the placeholder where the chunks get generated whenever application is built on production mode. We need to serve the contents within 'dist' folder to deploy/host the application with servers like Apache, HTTPD, NGINX etc.

```

## 14. What is `browserlists`?

```
Browserslist enables the sharing of target browser and Node.js version configurations between various frontend tools. It’s used in Autoprefixer, Babel, postcss-preset-env, eslint-plugin-compat, stylelint-no-unsupported-browser-features, postcss-normalize, obsolete-webpack-plugin.

All frontend tools will automatically target the desired browser versions when you add the following to your package.json:

  "browserslist": [
    "defaults and supports es6-module",
    "maintained node versions"
  ]

Refer: https://browserslist.dev/

```

## 15. Read about dif bundlers: vite, webpack, parcel

```
Vite is a web-based IDE that is designed to be a fast and lightweight alternative to traditional IDEs. It is a cloud-based IDE that runs on any device and is accessible from any browser

Parcel is a zero configuration web application bundler that is fast and easy to use.

webpack is a module bundler that bundles JavaScript files for usage in a browser.

```

## 16. Read about: ^ - caret and ~ - tilda

```
NPM versions are written using three dots separated numbers.

1. The first number from the left shows the major release,
2. The second number from the left shows the minor release and,
3. The third number shows the patch release of the package

Syntax: The syntax of the npm version looks like the following.

Major.Minor.Patch

Tilde (~) notation:
===================
It is used to match the most recent patch version.
Tilde ~ notation freezes the major version and minor version.
As we know patch updates are bug fixes that’s why we can say ~ notation
allows us to automatically accept bug fixes.

Caret (^) notation:
===================
It is used for automatically updating the minor updates along with patch updates.
Example: The ^1.2.4 will update all the future Minor and patch updates,
for example, ^1.2.4 will automatically change the dependency to 1.x.x if
any update occurs.

```

## 17. Read about Script types in html (MDN Docs)

```
The type attribute specifies the type of the script. The type attribute identifies
the content between the <script> and </script> tags.

Some common values:

A JavaScript MIME type like: application/javascript (default) or
application/ecmascript module:

Another MIME type. src attribute will be ignored
Look at IANA Media Types for a complete list of standard media types.

Refer: https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml

Browsers that support the module value for the type attribute ignore any script
with a nomodule attribute. That enables you to use module scripts while providing
nomodule-marked fallback scripts for non-supporting browsers.

<script type="module" src="main.js"></script>
<script nomodule src="fallback.js"></script>

```
