# Assignment 1

## 1. What is Emmet?

```
Emmet is a set of plug-ins for text editors that allows for high-speed coding and editing in HTML, XML, XSLT, and other structured code formats via content assist. The project was started by Vadim Makeev in 2008 and continues to be actively developed by Sergey Chikuyonok and Emmet users.

## 2. Difference between a Library and Framework?

```
With Frameworks, Developers need not start from scratch when they have tools to assist them like Frameworks.

A framework is like the foundation upon which developers build applications for specific platforms. It includes reusable pieces of code written to perform common tasks and uses code provided by a developer for custom functionality. The framework may include defined and undefined objects and functions that developers can use to create applications. In that way, we can add significant functionality to the system by using existing code around the structure.

On the other hand, A library is a collection of prewritten code that can be used to simplify tasks. The term library simply refers to a collection of code that is reused repeatedly. It is essentially a set of pre-defined functions and classes that programmers can use to simplify their work and speed up the development process. So, developers do not have to write code to accomplish specific functionality because the library already includes code for those functionalities. Standard libraries are available with most programming languages, but programmers can also make their own custom libraries.

## 3. What is CDN? Why do we use it?

```
A CDN (content delivery network), also called a content distribution network, is a group of geographically distributed and interconnected servers. They provide cached internet content from a network location closest to a user to speed up its delivery.

The primary goal of a CDN is to improve web performance by reducing the time needed to send content and rich media to users.

## 4. Why is React known as React?

```
React is called "React" because of its core feature, which is its ability to "react" or respond dynamically to changes in data. React was originally created by Facebook in 2011 for use in their own web applications, and it was released as an open-source project in 2013.

```

## 5. What is crossorigin in script tag?

```
The purpose of crossorigin attribute is to share the resources from one domain to another domain. Basically, it is used to handle the CORS request that checks whether it is safe to allow for sharing the resources from other domains. The resources may include Audio, Video, Images, Link or external script that specifies whether to support a cross-origin request or not.

CORS: It stands for cross-origin resource sharing which is a mechanism by which one webpage requests to another domain for fetching out the resource like audio, video, script, etc. from the third party server without leaking their credentials information.

```

## 6. What is diference between React and ReactDOM

```
React is a javascript library, designed for building better user interfaces. It contains the core building blocks for creating the components and react to data changes

On the other hand, React-DOM is a complimentary library to React which glues React to the browser DOM and helps React core library to modify browser DOM while reacting to data changes.

```

## 7. What is difference between react.development.js and react.production.js files via CDN?

```
The react.production.js files, implies the production mode, where compression and minification of Javascript and other resources is done to reduce size of the code to make it more performant which is not the case when it comes to development mode.

Performance will be much faster in production mode when compared to development mode where as debugging is quite lot easier in development mode than in production mode.
