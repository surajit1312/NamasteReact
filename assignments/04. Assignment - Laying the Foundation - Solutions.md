# Assignment 4

## 1. What is JSX?

```
JSX is a JavaScript Extension Syntax used in React to easily write HTML and JavaScript together.

For the below code:

const jsx = <h1>This is JSX</h1>

This is simple JSX code in React. But the browser does not understand this JSX because it's not valid JavaScript code. This is because we're assigning an HTML tag to a variable that is not a string but just HTML code.

So to convert it to browser understandable JavaScript code, we use a tool like Babel which is a JavaScript compiler/transpiler.
Every JSX is converted to the React.createElement function call that the browser understands.

The React.createElement has the following syntax:

React.createElement(type, [props], [...children])

```

## 2. Superpowers of JSX

```
JSX simplifies the creation of reusable components by enabling developers to define the structure, appearance, and behavior of elements in a declarative manner.

It enhances code readability, facilitates component composition, and allows for efficient rendering of dynamic data.

```

## 3. Role of type attribute in script tag? What options can I use there?

```
The type attribute specifies the type of the script. The type attribute identifies
the content between the <script> and </script> tags.

Some common values:

A JavaScript MIME type like: application/javascript (default) or
application/ecmascript module:

Another MIME type. src attribute will be ignored
Look at IANA Media Types for a complete list of standard media types.

Refer: https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml

Browsers that support the module value for the type attribute ignore any script
with a nomodule attribute. That enables you to use module scripts while providing
nomodule-marked fallback scripts for non-supporting browsers.

<script type="module" src="main.js"></script>
<script nomodule src="fallback.js"></script>

```

## 4. {TitleComponent} vs {<TitleComponent/>} vs {<TitleComponent></TitleComponent>} in JSX

```
For the below code:

const TitleComponent = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      {evaluatedVal}
      <Title />
      <h2>This is a Header Component from React Functional Component</h2>
      <h3>This is another Header Tag</h3>
    </div>
  );
};

They all work the same way, {TitleComponent} has to be called like:

    const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));

    Option 1: root.render(TitleComponent());

    or

    Option 2: root.render(<TitleComponent />);

    or

    Option 3: root.render(<TitleComponent></TitleComponent>);

```
